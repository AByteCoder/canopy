For vectors with fewer than 128 dimension and queries where `topK` is less than 50, p2 pods support up to 200 QPS per replica and return queries in less than 10ms. This means that query throughput and latency are better than s1 and p1.\\n\\n\\nEach p2 pod has enough capacity for around 1M vectors of 768 dimensions. However, capacity may vary with dimensionality.\\n\\n\\nThe data ingestion rate for p2 pods is significantly slower than for p1 pods; this rate decreases as the number of dimensions increases. For example, a p2 pod containing vectors with 128 dimensions can upsert up to 300 updates per second; a p2 pod containing vectors with 768 dimensions or more supports upsert of 50 updates per second. Because query latency and throughput for p2 pods vary from p1 pods, test p2 pod performance with your dataset.\\n\\n\\nThe p2 pod type does not support sparse vector values.\n",

To observe how your workloads perform on a given pod type, experiment with your own data set.\\n\\n\\nEach pod type supports four pod sizes: `x1`, `x2`, `x4`, and `x8`. Your index storage and compute capacity doubles for each size step. The default pod size is `x1`. You can increase the size of a pod after index creation.\\n\\n\\nTo learn about changing the pod size of an index, see [Manage indexes](manage-indexes/#changing-pod-sizes).\n",

      "document: ## Pods, pod types, and pod sizes\\n\\n\\nPods are pre-configured units of hardware for running a Pinecone service. Each index runs on one or more pods. Generally, more pods mean more storage capacity, lower latency, and higher throughput. You can also create pods of different sizes.\\n\\n\\nOnce an index is created using a particular pod type, you cannot change the pod type for that index. However, you can [create a new index from that collection](manage-indexes/#create-an-index-from-a-collection) with a different pod type.\\n\\n\\nDifferent pod types are priced differently. See [pricing](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) for more details.\\n\\n\\n### Starter plan\\n\\n\\nWhen using the starter plan, you can create one pod with enough resources to support approximately 100,000 vectors with 1536-dimensional embeddings and metadata; the capacity is proportional for other dimensions.\\n\\n\\nWhen using a starter plan, all [`create_index`](/reference/create_index) calls ignore the `pod_type` parameter.\n",
